Self-promotion and public exposure are not really my thing, so I am using an alias that is easy to google.
y background is in Chemical Engineering. I have worked as a as a software developer, project engineer, and researcher in academia and closely related organizations.   

Other personal interests are photography, aviation, and classical music. The latter however is fading away, as a profound hearing loss has developed over time and forced me to abandon my beloved piano! Thanks to modern hearing aids I am able to have a fairly normal life, until now. Keep your fingers crossed, my two little boys still need me.
