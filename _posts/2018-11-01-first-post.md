Creating a simple internet presence with some programming background is very simple. A particular fast track to a personal website and blog is [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Used primarily by software developers, the service offers an easy way to get your online presence up and running that won't cost you more than your time. However, depending on your background and familiarity with the tools, mastering the details may require some effort. 

## Overview

Your site will be hosted at username.github.io. A custom domain can be configured, if you have registered a domain name elsewhere. The site will be a static site, automatically generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from files residing in a  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository of your account hosted by GitHub.  In principle, no local software installation is required.


## Basic requirements 

+ a GitHub account
+ notions of file version control with Git
+ some knowledge of Markdown or HTML and Jekyll

To work locally with your preferred text editor, install Git. 

## Limitations

+ From the [Terms and Conditions](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) of GitHub pages,  the free web hosting is not allowed for commercial use (online business, e-commerce, facilitating commercial transactions, commercial software as a service) 
+ the site is static, with no server site code, therefore dynamic content is dependent on other services like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/); see however [staticman](https://staticman.net/) for a static comment solution. 

## How to start 

A fast track to your online presence  is starting with a template by "cloning" a respository with a theme and layout already set up. For this site I used [beautiful-jekyl](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) from Dean Attali. He gives detailed step-by-step instructions in the Readme.
