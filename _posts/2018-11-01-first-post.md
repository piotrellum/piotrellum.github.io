Creating a simple internet presence is a very simple task with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), also for non programmers. Used primarily by software developers, the service offers an easy way to get your online presence up and running that won't cost you more than your time. However, depending on your background and familiarity with the tools and configuration files, mastering the details may require some effort. 

## Overview

Your site will be hosted at username.github.io, but a custom domain can be configured if you have registered a domain name elsewhere. The site will be a static site, automatically generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) from files residing in a  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository hosted by GitHub.  In principle, no local software installation is required.


## Basic requirements 

+ a GitHub account
+ notions of file version control with Git (a tutorial is given [here](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Git/article.html))
+ some knowledge of [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) or HTML and Jekyll

To work locally with your preferred text editor, e.g. Visual Studio Code, install Git. 

## Limitations

+ From the [Terms and Conditions](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/) of GitHub pages,  the free web hosting is not allowed for commercial use (online business, e-commerce, facilitating commercial transactions, commercial software as a service) 
+ the site is static, with no server site code, therefore dynamic content is dependent on other services like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/); see however [staticman](https://staticman.net/) for a static comment solution. 

## How to start 

A fast track to your online presence  is starting with a template by "cloning" a respository with a theme and layout already set up. For this site I used [beautiful-jekyl](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) from Dean Attali. He gives detailed step-by-step instructions in the Readme.


##  Also free or low cost alternatives
